This folder contains source codes for the paper titled ‘Twinkle: A family of Low-latency Schemes for Authenticated Encryption and Pointer Authentication’.


#Runtime Reference
Obtaining differential bounds for the first 2 rounds requires approximately 41 days using the CaDiCal solver. For 4-round differential and linear bounds, it takes around 267 and 157 CPU days, respectively (this can be sped up with multithreading).
